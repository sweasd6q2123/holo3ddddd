# Models Directory

This directory should contain your 3D model files.

To use your own model:
1. Place your `.glb` file in this directory
2. The default model path is `/models/diva.glb`
3. You can also drag and drop `.glb` files directly onto the application

If you don't have a model file, you can download free GLB models from:
- https://sketchfab.com/3d-models?features=downloadable&sort_by=-likeCount
- https://poly.pizza/
- https://www.mixamo.com/

Make sure to place your `diva.glb` file in this directory for the application to work properly.
